There are some days when I feel surrounded by a lower vibration thought. Now i recognise it because i have had it before, many times before in my life. I feel unhappy with everything when that happens with my job, with myself, with my city, with the country that i live in. 

After speaking to a friend whom i share my thinking on spirituality and have shared my positive days when i have felt very vibrant and fulfilled, I start to feel better. My friend reminds me that i am slowly giving too much space to the negative thoughts. I must create space for the positive thoughts and remind myself of all the challenges i have overcome and how happy i have felt. Prayer is a way that gives us strength to find the strength to do that. She tells me that. I have done that before.  So i decide to go back to my routine of a silent prayer asking for guidance. In the prayer i realise that," I am so grateful to be where I am today, with my family, friends, aquaintances. "I have enjoyed a good rapport with my team in my previous job. t stayed like that for at least 2 yrs before it got bad. This will happen very often. I should still have good thoughts for my colleagues. Having a belief in the Universal energy, who looks after me and who'se presence i feel very often, makes me feel empowered . My self Beleif increases. I do not need approval from other people then. I am quite happy in my space. I say to myself" I am where I am meant to be, doing what i was meant for"

Near death Experiences teach me the following:

1. Death is not as scary it looks.



2.At the moment of death you are not alone.You are always supported. You do not feel any pain. You feel loved. So much so that you do not want to come back.

3. I feel empowered that i should use my life to do something worthwhile which will help others in their journey.
